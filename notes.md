# Advantages of COBOL
* Handles vast amounts of critical data stored in the largest servers e.g. the IBM Z Mainframe

# How is it used?
* 95% of ATM swipes
* 80% of in person transactions
* $3 trillion in commerce

* 200 times more COBOL transactions executed per day than Google searches
* 220 billion lines of COBOL running today - 80% of the world's actively used code
* 1.5 billion lines of new COBOL code written each year

# Why should I care?
* How the business works is found in the code
* over 50 years of refinement as a language
* COBOL is there, a lot of it works, and works very well


# VSCode with Zowe Explorer
Zowe Explorer - and open-source extension for VSCode that lets developers and sysadmins interact with z/OS mainframes using VSCode.

## Introduction
* Modern approach to z/OS mainframe development
  * Create, modify, rename, copy and upload data to a z/OS
  * do the same with USS files
  * streamlined process to access data sets, USS files and jobs
  * Create and use Zowe CLI `zosmf` compatible profiles

## Profiles in Zowe Explorer
* The URL for the API services to connect to and credentials
* main profile info needed: z/OSMF Connection

### Secure Credentials
* Possible to secure credentials using the plugin

_Further sections ommitted - just instructions for working with Zowe_

# VSCode with Z Open Editor
## What is it?
* fee extension to VSC
* Support for COBOL, PL/I and JCL languages
  * PL/I - Programming Language 1, a procedural, imperative computer programming language
  * JCL - Job Control Language, scripting languages used on the IBM mainframe OSs
* Also content assistance for apps that call CICS, MQ, IMS and DB2 APIs
* Code can reside on
